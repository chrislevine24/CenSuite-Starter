# Simple Next.js/ CenSuite Starter

A minimal Next.js 14 starter template using the App Router, ShadCN/UI, type-safe environment variables, built-in icon support, and preconfigured settings. Designed for simplicity, it offers a plug-and-play setup ideal for first-time Next.js and ShadCN users.

## Background

CenSuite is a design system focused on delivering better user experiences through faster, more consistent frontends. It blends expert-crafted UI patterns from the XD team with optimized React tooling to reduce development overhead and improve design accuracy. Every component is built to be accessible, responsive, and performantâ€”helping teams ship applications that feel cohesive, intuitive, and fast. With over 50 reusable, fully customizable components styled using centralized design tokens, CenSuite dramatically reduces developer effort while ensuring brand and UX consistency out of the box.
